# Python-week2 Repo

This repository contains Python scripts and exercises for practicing basic Python programming concepts, especially focusing on list operations.

## File Structure

- `main.py`: Demonstrates various list operations in Python such as appending, inserting, extending, removing elements, sorting, and finding the index of a value.

## Example: List Operations

The `main.py` file performs the following actions:

1. **Creates an empty list**
2. **Appends elements**: 10, 20, 30, 40
3. **Inserts** 15 at the second position
4. **Extends** the list with `[50, 60, 70]`
5. **Removes** the last element
6. **Sorts** the list in ascending order
7. **Finds and prints** the index of the value 30
8. **Prints** the final list

### Sample Output

```
Index of 30: 3
Final list: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
```
